# Exploring the Potential of Deep Learning in Pathological Gait Detection

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my research on utilizing Deep Learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and their hybrids, for gait classification. The project focuses on analyzing skeletal and silhouette images, as well as a multimodal approach combining both, to identify normal and abnormal gaits.

## Dataset
The models were trained and tested on publicly available datasets. 

## Key Findings
- **Skeletal vs. Silhouette Images**: Skeletal images provided more accurate diagnostic information compared to silhouette and multimodal images.
- **Model Performance**: CNN-based models showed superior performance and greater data efficiency over LSTM-based and hybrid models.
- **Limitations**: The study encountered limitations including dataset representativeness, data imbalances, computational resources, and potential exploration of other Deep learning architectures.
